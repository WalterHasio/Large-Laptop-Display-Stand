# Large-Laptop-Display-Stand
Display stand for a full size (15 or 16") laptop, designed to raise the height of the display (please do not try to use the keyboard this way).  While it's designed specifically for a 2017 15" Apple Macbook Pro, but should work with some other 15" laptop models.  It seems to work fin on the 15.6" Dell and Lenovo laptop I tested.
